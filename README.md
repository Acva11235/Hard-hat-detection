# üöß Hard Hat Detection using Efficientdet D0 üë∑

## Overview
The **Hard Hat Detection Project** aims to enhance construction site safety by detecting workers not wearing hard hats through CCTV footage. Utilizing advanced object detection techniques, this project processes live video streams to identify safety violations in real-time.

## üß† Model and working
This project leverages the TensorFlow Model Zoo with the EfficientDet D0 (512x512) model, trained on a dataset of 10,000 construction images comprising over 20,000 objects. The model was trained for 30,000 steps, ensuring high accuracy and robustness in diverse environments.

## ‚ö° Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes live CCTV footage for immediate detection of hard hat violations.
- **Violation Logging**: Saves images of detected violations in a 'violations' folder for later review by managers.
- **Auditory Alert**: Plays a siren instantly upon detecting a worker without a hard hat, ensuring immediate awareness.

## üíª Usage
To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hard-hat-detection.git
   ```
2. **Load the appropriate model**:
    ```python
    ```
3. **Use the model with footage**: As described in the Detection steps of the training file.
